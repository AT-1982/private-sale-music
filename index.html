    <p>2022: they are back
      Good news for fans of Matthew Bellamy and his band, the British group is finally back! Muse releases "Will of the People", a very hard rock new album, a concentrate of the best of what the famous trio of rockers can do. To introduce the public to its titles live, the group is embarking on a major European tour from May 2023. Very attached to France, Muse is also offering fans four dates in France (Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseilles).</p>
